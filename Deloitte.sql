Based on the content of this course, which are the appropriate resources to turn to for help and reporting of concerns about work-related ethical challenges?
1,2,3

Key points
Glenn Stastny and his team would like to encourage you to remember the following key points as you progress in your career at Deloitte:

You should never feel inclined to attempt to resolve ethical challenges on your own.
When these challenges arise, raise your hand and seek help from colleagues in your managerial chain-of-command, who have more experience and who can collaborate with you to identify the best course of action.
Make sure to consult the many helpful resources Deloitte provides, including our Shared Values, our Code of Ethics, Talent, and the Integrity Helpline, whenever something at work or a client site seems ethically questionable.


You’ve almost reached the end of this course. Take a moment and consider how well you 
can do these things now:

Recognize the Shared Values that articulate who we are and what we stand for at Deloitte.
Apply our Shared Values to various ethical challenges.
Identify components of Deloitte’s Ethics program, which are available to help you.
Next, take another look at our Shared Values in the downloadable resource document. 
Theen, spend some time memorizing them. In the days ahead, you’ll have opportunities to add 
to what you’ve learned about Deloitte’s culture and Shared Values in this course, so you’ll 
be better prepared to take action if you’re faced with or become aware of an ethical 
challenge.

Finally, remember that at Deloitte, when we set high standards, always act with integrity, 
collaborate effectively across the organization, and deliver outstanding value to 
our clients, we can truly thrive.

2) /* Introduction to Deloitte Tracking & Trading */

Welcome to Introduction to Deloitte Tracking & Trading.

This course is made up of eight interactive lessons that you can move through at your own pace. When each lesson and all required activities are completed, the lesson title will be highlighted and marked with a check. Once you’ve completed all the lessons, you will be able to access the final exam. This course will take around 90 minutes to complete.

To begin, select the first lesson, What are my responsibilities?, and you''ll learn how this online training works.

Because of your role in the Deloitte US Firms, you are required to maintain a portfolio of your Financial Relationships in the Tracking & Trading system. This portfolio must be kept current at all times.

After completing the course, you will:

Recognize how the Tracking & Trading system supports Deloitte’s Independence Policy.
Identify Financial Relationships that are attributable to you and require monitoring.
Recognize how the Tracking & Trading system is used to report Financial Relationships.
Identify the responsibilities you have for maintaining - and keeping current - your portfolio in the Tracking & Trading system.

Your requirements
At this stage in your career (a newly hired, directly admitted or promoted Partner or Professional Staff, or other role change), there are three primary compliance areas that require your immediate attention.

Mandatory Learning
Tracking & Trading
Representation

Tracking & Trading
Populate and maintain your Tracking & Trading portfolio in the Deloitte Tracking & Trading system. Enter the name, but not the quantity or value, of certain Financial Relationships. 
Your information must be kept current and 
should be reviewed periodically and whenever there is a change in your Financial Relationships.
**Everyone will have something to report because, at a minimum, the institution where your paycheck is direct deposited is reportable.


Representation
Submit a special purpose representation where you will be asked to respond to a number of questions regarding your compliance with independence and other firm policies in addition to attesting to the completeness of your Tracking & Trading portfolio. Periodic Representations on Independence, Ethics, and Compliance will be required throughout your employment/association with Deloitte.



Maintaining compliance
Your compliance with Independence Policy is monitored by Independence & Conflicts Network. Noncompliance with any of your Independence Requirements is subject to disciplinary action as set forth in APR 105 Expectations Concerning Independence Policies Concerning Ethics and Compliance Standards and the Consequences of Noncompliance. If you are found to be in violation of Independence Policy, the result can be a policy Violation or a regulation Violation. Depending on the severity of the Violation, the consequences can range from a warning to monetary implications and, in rare situations, termination.

Any questions you may have regarding your responsibilities to comply with Independence Policy can be directed to any of the following:

The Compliance HelpDesk
Independence & Conflicts Network
Your local office Audit Professional Practice Director (Audit PPD)
Functional Risk Manager
For contact information, visit the Independence Contacts page on DeloitteNet.




1) Which of the following will review the information supplied in
your Tracking & Trading portfolio?

The SEC/PCAOB/AICPA and internal personnel in Independence & Conflicts Network will 
review the information supplied in your Tracking & Trading portfolio.

2) 
If you do not comply with Independence policy, you are subject to disciplinary action. Noncompliance with any of your Independence Requirements is subject to disciplinary action as set forth in APR 105 Expectations Concerning Ethics and Compliance Standards and the Consequences of Noncompliance.
The Tracking & Trading system will help you maintain compliance with Independence Policy and is your responsibility to maintain. Your information must be kept current and should be reviewed whenever there is a change in your Financial Relationships.
The My Compliance Dashboard will list your outstanding independence requirements in detail and provide due dates.
The solution to the exercise is now shown.

IPSF Report :- 
https://deloittenet.deloitte.com/PC/PracticeComm/regions/India/SS/Finance/Pages/IPSF.aspx

Professionals who’ve submitted IPSF during the annual IPSF window, must check the status of 
their IPSF submissions to know their tax liability for deductions in February and March payroll.
It is recommended that they go through the IPSF approval/ reject reports, that will be hosted on 
HR Workways usually in second week of February. They will also be able to understand their final 
Income Tax liability applicable for a particular FY (as on that date) by viewing the mock income 
tax computation sheet which will also be hosted on HR Workways for their 
reference during the same time.

Important points to keep in mind:

This is only applicable to Full Time Employees who’ve submitted their IPSF and uploaded proofs on HR workways during December (applicable existing employees) and January (applicable for new hires).
The IPSF approval report will not be available to professionals who didn’t take any action on IPSF submission or whose IPSF submission was incomplete, for those professionals, only their mock tax computation sheets will be available showing the tax liability for deductions in February and March payroll.
Proofs submitted will be validated and approved as per IPSF & IT guidelines.
If any of the proofs get rejected, the reject reason will be shown on the IPSF approval report itself.
If all proofs were submitted as per IPSF guidelines and if they have been rejected erroneously, professionals must write to info@ceridian.com immediately (not later than the timeline mentioned in the mail communication) providing details of discrepancies observed. Such discrepancies will be handled appropriately and rectified in February payslip (as applicable).
Any discrepancies reported post the timeline mentioned in mail communication, will not be considered.
No additional proofs or investment details will be considered post January. Professionals will have to claim the tax benefit for such proofs while filing their income tax returns.
Further communications on the approval window dates will be released by Info Ceridian team.  



Important Note ? Action Required:
As per our record, you have not submitted the Signed Form 12BB. The signed Form 12BB submission 
is mandatory to consider investment details for tax calculation as per IT Rule. 
Even though the qualifying investment details status shows as ?Approved? in this 
report, it will not be considered for Tax calculation unless the signed Form 12BB 
is submitted. Hence, you are requested to send the signed scanned copy to 
info@ceridian.com by mentioning your company name, employee id 
in the body of the email and subject line as ?Form 12BB Signed Copy?.
